i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .####[['qc', 'company quality', 'negative', 'disappointed'], ['qc', 'company quality', 'negative', 'poor']]
unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .####[['screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .####[['screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .####[['samsung', 'support operation_performance', 'negative', 'doubtful']]
no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .####[['apple product', 'support general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .####[['product', 'laptop quality', 'negative', 'cautious']]
wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy touchscreen with google play support .####[['touchscreen', 'display operation_performance', 'positive', 'NULL']]
first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'infamous']]
yes , it ' s absolute garbage .####[['NULL', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'garbage']]
i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'NULL']]
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .####[['keyboards', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'worst']]
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .####[['NULL', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'sluggish']]
i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .####[['screen', 'display general', 'positive', 'best']]
it does indeed look excellent !####[['NULL', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'excellent']]
it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .####[['trackpad', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
if you are indifferent about the screen , do not buy this !####[['screen', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .####[['chromebook', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .####[['power button', 'keyboard design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .####[['screen', 'display quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any warranties .####[['warranties', 'warranty quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .####[['touch screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'surprised']]
my screen stayed black more than it was on .####[['screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
samsung needs to fix that issue .####[['samsung', 'company general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
possible note , it was very light .####[['NULL', 'laptop portability', 'positive', 'light']]
while this thing is gorgeous and the perfect size for what i was looking for , my initial display died after not even 12 hours of use .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'gorgeous'], ['NULL', 'laptop design_features', 'positive', 'perfect']]
except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .####[['it', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'unusable']]
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .####[['device', 'laptop operation_performance', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
awesome display .####[['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'awesome']]
fast boot and reliable os .####[['boot', 'os operation_performance', 'positive', 'fast'], ['boot', 'os operation_performance', 'positive', 'reliable'], ['os', 'os operation_performance', 'positive', 'fast'], ['os', 'os operation_performance', 'positive', 'reliable'], ['os', 'os miscellaneous', 'positive', 'NULL']]

mouse track pad is non standard .####[['mouse track pad', 'hardware operation_performance', 'negative', 'non standard']]
it ' s hard to navigate and i had to buy a usb mouse and a usb connector .####[['NULL', 'hardware operation_performance', 'negative', 'hard']]
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .####[['device', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'worth']]
it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'limited'], ['operating system', 'os operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
the quality is is meh .####[['the quality', 'laptop quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .####[['NULL', 'laptop design_features', 'negative', 'cheap'], ['keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'bad']]
it simply feels like a cheap samsung tablet with a keyboard attached .####[['samsung tablet', 'laptop miscellaneous', 'negative', 'cheap']]
the playstore its immature .####[['playstore', 'software usability', 'negative', 'immature']]
their designs are made for phones and on this huge screen , they are palpitated .####[['designs', 'software design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .####[['chrome browser', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'expensive']]
i do not recommend it at this price point .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'not recommend']]
i would however spend $ 300 on this device .####[['device', 'laptop price', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
its current price is not worth it .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'not worth']]
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .####[['web browsing', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .####[['laptop', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'unusable']]
after some googling i realized that the wifi issue was related to bluetooth being on .####[['wifi', 'ports operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .####[['stylus', 'hardware operation_performance', 'negative', 'failed'], ['stylus', 'hardware operation_performance', 'negative', 'stuck']]
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .####[['touch pad', 'hardware operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
you know , i wanted to love this machine .####[['machine', 'laptop general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .####[['android apps', 'software usability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard operation_performance', 'negative', 'bad']]
' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
so one star off for the keyboard .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .####[['NULL', 'os operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .####[['android versions', 'software usability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .####[['display', 'display general', 'positive', 'nice']]
if you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred bucks for that , rock on .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'negative', 'NULL']]
unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .####[['chromebook', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'dead']]
the problem is that it never charged .####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
the cable functions just fine .####[['cable', 'power_supply operation_performance', 'neutral', 'fine']]
the chromebook is simply dead from what i can tell .####[['chromebook', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'dead']]
as you can see , the cable is active , but the ` ` power led ` ` has never had any color .####[['cable', 'power_supply operation_performance', 'neutral', 'active'], ['power led', 'power_supply quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
very disappointing , samsung !####[['samsung', 'company general', 'negative', 'disappointing']]
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .####[['product', 'laptop operation_performance', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .####[['metal slab', 'laptop operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .####[['google', 'company operation_performance', 'positive', 'NULL']]
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .####[['pro', 'fans&cooling operation_performance', 'negative', 'hotter'], ['battery life', 'battery operation_performance', 'negative', 'shorter']]
initially the product lived up to the expectations .####[['product', 'laptop general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .####[['chromebook specific apps', 'software design_features', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['google play store apps', 'software design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .####[['NULL', 'laptop quality', 'negative', 'terrible'], ['touch screen', 'display operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .####[['case', 'hardware design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'horrible'], ['pixel', 'display quality', 'negative', 'dead'], ['stylus', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['bluetooth', 'ports operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .####[['stylus', 'hardware quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
customer service told me that i ' d have to buy a new one , item is still under warranty .####[['customer service', 'support general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
i picked up the stylus and it fell apart , no drops no damage .####[['stylus', 'hardware quality', 'negative', 'NULL']]
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .####[['samsung', 'company general', 'negative', 'garbage']]
never again will i buy samsung products and thats what i ' d suggest here .####[['samsung products', 'company general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
no caps lock on the keyboard .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .####[['app', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'compromised']]
apps have to close and be reopened to get them to a somewhat decent size .####[['apps', 'software usability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
chrome os is not matured in any way .####[['chrome os', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
it calls itself a computer , but it ' s really not .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .####[['chromeos', 'os usability', 'negative', 'NULL']]
google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .####[['google', 'company general', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .####[['chromeos', 'os general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
apps are glitchy .####[['apps', 'software usability', 'negative', 'glitchy']]
samsung sent me a new stylus free of charge and free of hassle , which was nice of them because the top of the oem stylus popped off one day and could not be reassembled .####[['stylus', 'hardware general', 'positive', 'nice'], ['oem stylus', 'hardware general', 'negative', 'NULL']]
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .####[['apps', 'software operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .####[['plastic piece', 'hardware design_features', 'negative', 'NULL']]
i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .####[['voltage', 'ports operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .####[['charging port', 'ports operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['usb c', 'ports operation_performance', 'negative', 'NULL']]
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .####[['touchpad', 'hardware design_features', 'negative', 'annoying']]
many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .####[['displays', 'display general', 'negative', 'poor']]
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .####[['display', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'fantastic'], ['display', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'excellent']]
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .####[['NULL', 'display operation_performance', 'positive', 'fantastic']]
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .####[['acer display', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'wonderful']]
a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .####[['chrome os devices', 'memory operation_performance', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .####[['ram', 'memory operation_performance', 'positive', 'great']]
the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .####[['screen', 'display general', 'positive', 'great'], ['NULL', 'laptop design_features', 'positive', 'sharp'], ['storage', 'memory operation_performance', 'positive', 'nice'], ['intel processor', 'cpu operation_performance', 'positive', 'solid']]
it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'better']]
the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .####[['acer', 'laptop price', 'positive', 'nice']]
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .####[['i / o', 'ports connectivity', 'positive', 'decent']]
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .####[['n3160', 'cpu operation_performance', 'negative', 'exaggerating']]
it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;####[['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'solid'], ['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'decent'], ['NULL', 'laptop operation_performance', 'positive', 'NULL']]
none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !####[['acer chromebook 14', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'excellent']]
i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .####[['NULL', 'laptop miscellaneous', 'positive', 'decently']]
5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .####[['emmc storage', 'memory operation_performance', 'negative', 'slower']]
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .####[['acer', 'company general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .####[['touchpad', 'keyboard operation_performance', 'positive', 'best'], ['keyboard', 'keyboard operation_performance', 'positive', 'best']]
anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )####[['chromebook', 'laptop usability', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['app - like extensions', 'software usability', 'positive', 'novel']]
for an office , you can give everyone a chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign - out , and the machines can also be remotely managed if you ' re a google apps customer .####[['chromebook', 'laptop usability', 'positive', 'NULL']]
for students and road warriors , the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync - ing a breeze , especially if you hotspot from your phone .####[['battery life', 'battery operation_performance', 'positive', 'NULL']]
from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date####[['chromebook', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'best']]
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .####[['keyboard', 'keyboard general', 'positive', 'nice']]

thus far , i am very happy with the purchase , and highly recommend it .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'happy'], ['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'recommend']]
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .####[['NULL', 'laptop quality', 'positive', 'like'], ['NULL', 'laptop quality', 'positive', 'sturdy']]

it ' s the best solution i ' ve used for collaborating on a budget .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'positive', 'best']]
however , know what you ' re buying before you get a chromebook : it operates on a chrome operating system and you can ' t install apps or games on it like world of warcraft .####[['chromebook', 'laptop usability', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare !####[['screen quality', 'display quality', 'positive', 'perfect']]
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .####[['keys on the keyboard are', 'keyboard design_features', 'negative', 'low']]
it take a bit of getting used to .####[['NULL', 'keyboard usability', 'neutral', 'NULL']]
first off the chromebook itself is excellent , one of the few budget models with 1080p and a long battery life .####[['chromebook', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'excellent'], ['battery life', 'battery operation_performance', 'positive', 'long']]
it arrived in ` ` as new ` ` condition despite being a refurbished ( likely a return ) .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'NULL']]
it is a steal at $ 179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons .####[['NULL', 'laptop price', 'positive', 'worth']]
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .####[['NULL', 'laptop design_features', 'negative', 'heavier']]

it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .####[['NULL', 'laptop general', 'positive', 'great'], ['build', 'laptop quality', 'positive', 'solid'], ['screen', 'display general', 'positive', 'good'], ['resolution', 'display design_features', 'positive', 'insane'], ['keyboard', 'keyboard design_features', 'positive', 'decent']]
